# Joe Clancy ePortfolio
## CS499 Computer Science Capstone, Dec 2024

This repository contains all of the supporting material for my ePortfolio, the CS499 Computer Science Capstone final project. This includes the original software artifacts from previous courses, the enhanced artifacts developed for this course, a video code review of the original artifact, journal and narrative papers discussing my thoughts and process as I completed the work, and the HTML for the final ePortfolio presentation.
